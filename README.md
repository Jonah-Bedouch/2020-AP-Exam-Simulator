# 2020 AP Exam Simulator

A simulator designed **for Google Chrome on Desktop** which emulates the conditions of an actual AP Exam to allow for better practicing.

Built as a project in 15 hours. Frameworkless. Shoddy code? Yes. Backwards compatibility? Not before like Chrome 33... Which to be fair isn't horrible.

Anyway, this project was built more as a "This would help me study" tool than as an actual full fledged solution... since if it was that, the code would not be this shoddy. If you find bugs, please go ahead and report them and I'll try to fix them, though to be fair there's like a week until the exams so it likely won't matter anyway.

Thanks and Enjoy!
